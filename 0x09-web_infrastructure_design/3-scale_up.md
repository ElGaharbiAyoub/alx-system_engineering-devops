## Explanation of Additional Elements:

**Load Balancer Cluster:** A cluster of load balancers enhances fault tolerance and distributes traffic evenly among the web servers. If one load balancer goes down, the other continues to handle traffic, minimizing downtime and improving user experience.

**Separate Components (Web, Application, Database):** Splitting components into their own servers provides isolation and better resource utilization. This separation allows each component to scale independently based on its specific requirements. It also helps in isolating potential issues, making troubleshooting easier.
