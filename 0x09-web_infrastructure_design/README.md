**What you should learn from this project**

       At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain, without the
       help of Google:

- You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops
  track projects
- You must be able to explain what are each component doing
- You must be able to explain system redundancy
- Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

**Exercises**

**0. Simple web stack**

A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure, a lot of time it is composed of a
single server with a LAMP stack.

On a whiteboard, design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is
reachable via www.foobar.com. Start your explanation by having a user wanting to access
your website.

Requirements:

- You must use:
  - 1 server
  - 1 web server (Nginx)
  - 1 application server
  - 1 application files (your code base)
  - 1 database (MySQL)
  - 1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8

**1. Distributed web infrastructure**

On a whiteboard, design a three servers web infrastructure that host the website www.foobar.com.

Requirements:

- You must add:
  - 2 servers
  - 1 web server (Nginx)
  - 1 application server
  - 1 load-balancer (HAproxy)
  - 1 application files (your code base)
  - 1 database (MySQL)

**2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure**

On a whiteboard, design a three servers web infrastructure that host the website
www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic and be monitored.

Requirements:

- You must add:
  - 3 firewalls
  - 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
  - 3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)
