## 0x0A. SSH

**What you should learn from this project**

       At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to
       anyone, without the help of Google:

- What is a server
- Where server usually live
- What is SSH
- How to create an SSH RSA key pair
- How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair

**Requirements**

- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash

The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash for instance is that it will make your script portable for different OS where Bash might be in a different location.
